Getting embedding for:involve focus and alertness. Those are slightly different than meditations that involve lack of focus and attention to say internal states. I'm going to pause there and then I want to talk about kids and the elderly. In other words, how do we control sleep and circadian rhythms and wakefulness in babies, adolescents, teens, and age folks? All right, before we 
Getting embedding for:talk about sleep and kids, I want to tell a little story. It's not a joke. Many of you will be relieved that I'm not going to try and tell another joke this episode, which is the relationship between light, skin and pillage color, dopamine, and reproduction, mating. So many seasonally breeding animals, Siberian hamsters, which I mentioned earlier, rabbits, fox, 
Getting embedding for:other animals change their color of their coat. In the winter, they tend to be a lighter color, sometimes pure white, sometimes with flecks of black or brown. And in the summer, their pillage changes to a color of brown or red, some other vastly different color. That shift is controlled by light and by melatonin. This has an interesting correlate in humans. So humans 
Getting embedding for:obviously have different skin tones, just genetically because of the amount of melanin in one skin, depending on genetic background. But of course, sunlight will increase the amount of melanin in the skin regardless, right? This is suntan, sunburn, et cetera, bronzing, whatever. The whole system is wired so that shifts in skin color and shifts in these cells 
Getting embedding for:within the eye and melatonin are actually very closely linked. So here's the story. Many years ago, meaning about 10 years ago, 15 years ago, let's see, it was 20 years ago, forgive me, a guy named Iggy Provencio, who was running his own lab at Uniformed Arms Services. This is a standard biological laboratory, discovered that there was an opsin in the eye, in the 
Getting embedding for:cells of the eye that connect to the rest of the brain called melanopsin. Melanopsin, as many of you now know, is the opsin. It's like a pigment. It absorbs light. It is the opsin that converts light into electrical signals that then set the circadian clock. Iggy discovered melanopsin because it was similar in form to what was in frog melanophores. It was actually 
Getting embedding for:in the skin of frogs that allowed those frogs to go from pale white when it was dark for most of the 24-hour cycle to pigmented green or brown for a frog. So there's this relationship between the cells in our eye and the pigment cells of our skin. And we also know that in long days, there's more breeding. How does that work? Well, that's actually from dopamine triggering 
Getting embedding for:increases in testosterone, mainly in males and estrogen, mainly in females. Although of course there's testosterone and estrogen in both sexes. So we have this kind of pathway where it's light, increases in melanin, dopamine and reproduction on the one hand and lack of light, melatonin decreases in the darkness of skin, less melanin in the skin or in the case 
Getting embedding for:of an animal with fur, white fur and no reproduction on the other hand. And humans don't actually shift their breeding patterns tremendously from long days and short days, although there are some data that there's some shifts. We also don't radically change our skin color depending on how much sunlight exposure we have. But the simple way to put this is when days 
Getting embedding for:are long, there's a lot more dopamine and we feel really good and there's a lot more breeding and breeding like behavior. When days are short, there's a lot less dopamine and a lot less breeding behavior because these pathways are very highly conserved. Now, what's interesting is that as we've moved into a modern society where much of our waking days, we are looking 
Getting embedding for:at screens, which is fine because we're getting a lot of light that way, although not as much as sunlight, but also at night, we're getting a lot of light from screens. What's happened is all these pathways, melanin in the skin, turnover of skin cells, dopamine, all of this stuff has become completely disrupted. Now that's not to say that we should go back to a time 
Getting embedding for:in which we didn't use artificial lights, but I think the important thing to realize is that feeling good with getting a lot of light, the relationship to dopamine and melanin in the skin and the good feelings of getting light also on our skin, provided you're not getting burned or you're not getting excessive UV exposure, those are not just coincidences. Those 
Getting embedding for:are hardwired biological mechanisms that exist in everybody, regardless of how light or dark your skin is to begin with. There's another point which is important, which is that the dopamine system, which is this feel good molecule, is very closely related to the testosterone and estrogen and reproductive cycles. Remember, melatonin inhibits gonadotropin 
Getting embedding for:releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone and the production of these hormones, and melatonin is the effector, it is the hormone of darkness. So I just threw a lot of biology at you, and I'm not saying you're like a Siberian hamster, at least not in ways that I'm aware of, I'm not saying that your pelage color is going to change. Actually, the reason people go gray is 
Getting embedding for:because when you're really stressed, did you know this, when you're really stressed, there's an increase in the nerve fibers that release adrenaline to the hair follicle, and that activates peroxide groups in the hair follicle that cause the hair to actually go gray or white. So actually stress does make your hair gray or white, aging does it too. That was a brief 
Getting embedding for:aside, but for those of you that are interested in the relationship between light and skin tone and all that kind of stuff, I thought you might find it interesting that these cells in your eye are a lot like the skin cells in frogs or in animals that shift their entire color and sometimes metamorphosize. You know, there are some species that literally change shape 
Getting embedding for:and the reproductive organs. In fact, if that wasn't weird enough, when I was in graduate school at Berkeley, there was another graduate student studying a species of hermaphroditic mole, right, those little things that dig, hermaphroditic mole that would change from having ovaries to testes and back again, depending on day life. Super cool, super different 
Getting embedding for:and wild biological mechanism. If you're wondering how those animals reproduce, they actually adjust the numbers of males and females, depending on the density of males and females. So if they're too many males, some of the males turn their testes into ovaries. And if they're too many females, they turn their ovaries into testes. They actually are true hermaphroditic 
Getting embedding for:animals as opposed to pseudo hermaphroditic animals. Okay, let's get back on track. Let's talk about the animal that most of you care about, which is the human animal, new parents and babies. All right, as I mentioned earlier, melatonin is not cyclic, it's not cycling in babies. It's more phasic, it's being released at a kind of a constant level. And babies tend 
Getting embedding for:to be smaller than adults, they are. And so those concentrations of melatonin are very high. As a baby grows, those concentrations per unit volume are going to go down. Babies are not born with a typical sleep-wake cycle. And now all the parents saying, "'Tell me something I didn't know.'" They also have, and I really want to emphasize this, they also have much more 
Getting embedding for:sensitive optics of the eye. So a number of people have asked me, should I be exposing my baby to sunlight? You don't want to avoid sunlight, but their eyes are very sensitive. The optics of their eyes aren't quite developed. So much so that, you know, when you look at a newborn baby and they kind of, they look a little glassy-eyed and they're kind of looking through 
Getting embedding for:you or even a young child, a lot of people think that they're seeing you the way that you're seeing them. Hate to break it to you, but if you ever can just Google visual image of a like a one month old, the optics of their eyes are so poor that you're a cloudy image. They're not seeing your fine detail. As the optics get better, then they will see you with more and more clarity. 
Getting embedding for:But a lot of that is clearing of the lens and some of the other aqueous features of the newborn eye. They don't see very well, but they also don't have such great ways of adjusting to bright light. And so babies have a natural version to bright light. So you really want to avoid trying to use sunlight or really bright light in the same way that you would for an adult on a 
Getting embedding for:young baby or child. As children get older, however, melatonin does start to become slightly more cyclic, slightly more cycled, and their body temperature rhythms also start to fall into a more regular, not quite 24 hour rhythm. They're more of these all trading rhythms. So in episode, I think it was one or two of the podcast or maybe both, we talked about these 
Getting embedding for:90 minute so-called all trade in rhythms where every 90 minutes, babies are going through a cycle of body temperature and some other hormonal features. I mean, so much is changing in their system. So what to do if a child isn't sleeping? You can use phases of darkness and phases of light, but they're going to have to be shortened in order to try and encourage sleep 
Getting embedding for:when you want the child to sleep. It's not that they're just not going to fall into an adult light regime of a temperature minimum and a temperature maximum. Their temperature minimums and maximums are fluctuating much more quickly. And it varies tremendously. Actually, there's an interesting literature of whether or not they have siblings, whether or not 
Getting embedding for:they're twins, whether or not they're in a nursery environment, whether or not they're alone. Well, hopefully the baby's not alone, but you know what I mean, that they're sleeping alone in a room while you're in the other room. There are a couple of things that seem to help, which is getting the overall environment onto a 24 hour schedule. So having the room slightly 
Getting embedding for:colder, obviously you want babies to be nice and cozy, slightly colder when you would like them to be asleep, slightly warmer for the times you would like them to be awake. Babies tend to run pretty hot anyway. And obviously you want to be very careful about avoiding all extremes of temperature, cold or hot. So if they're going through these 90 minute cycles, you're 
Getting embedding for:going to have to adjust to those 90 minute cycles as well. So then people say, well, that's not going to help me at all because how do I deal with the fact that I need to be up every 90 minutes at night? There are a couple tools that can be helpful. The first one is going to be to try and understand the relationship between calm and deep sleep. So the autonomic nervous system 
Getting embedding for:can put us into states of panic where that's kind of seesaw of autonomic alertness goes all the way to panic, or it can be alertness or it can be alert and calm, right? So there's a range there, it's a continuum. Can also be that you're in deep sleep. So the other end of the seesaw is way up or you're in light sleep or you're kind of sleepy or you're just feeling kind of relaxed. 
Getting embedding for:Perhaps the most important thing if you're having to map to a baby's schedule in order to make sure that they're getting changings and nursing, et cetera, at the appropriate times is to try and maintain as, if you can't sleep or you can't sleep continuously, to try and maintain your autonomic nervous system in a place where you're not going into heightened states 
Getting embedding for:of alertness when you would ideally be sleeping. Now, I realized that this could be translated to try and stay calm while you're sleep deprived, which is very hard for people to do, but this is where the non-sleep deep breath protocol surface again, and can potentially be very beneficial for people to be able to recover not necessarily sleep, but for them to maintain 
Getting embedding for:a certain amount of autonomic regulation. So what would this look like? This would look like the baby goes down, maybe it's only going to go down for 45 minutes. If you can capture sleep, capture sleep, there are some data showing what's called polyphasic sleep. If you can sleep in 45 minute increments or batches, even if it's spread throughout the day with periods 
Getting embedding for:of wakefulness in between, as miserable as that sound, there are actually some adults that have deliberately employed that who don't have children for sake of work productivity. And it does tend to reduce the total overall amount of sleep that you need. It is a very hard schedule for most people to maintain, but if you have a baby, the baby may be throwing you into 
Getting embedding for:that kind of schedule anyway, so if you can get 45 minutes sleep while they sleep, great. If you can get another 45 minutes after waking and then they go back down to sleep, great. So as many phases of sleep as you can get, but if you can't sleep, the data on non-sleep deep breath type protocols does show that at least from a neurochemical level, want to be clear what that 
Getting embedding for:means, reset of things like dopamine levels in the basal ganglia measured by things like positron emission, tomography, et cetera, those things tend to reset themselves pretty well if you can access these deep rest states. So that means not being alert throughout the entire time that the baby is sleeping, trying to sort of mirror the baby's sleep cycle, which 
Getting embedding for:can be brutal for certain people. And especially if you're trying to prepare meals and do all these things. So I do recognize that there are a lot of constraints on parenting, not just mapping on your baby's sleep schedule. As children approach ages one, two, three, four, that's when certainly the optics of the eyes have improved, but you don't want to damage the 
Getting embedding for:eyes, of course, with very bright light. They are much more sensitive even until they're kind of 10, 11 years old. And we'll talk about vision in children in a moment, but trying to get longer and longer batches of sleep through, hopefully not through the use of administering melatonin to the kids, because that's what I talked about before, why that could potentially 
Getting embedding for:be detrimental. Talk about that with your doctor. But more so trying to get longer blocks of sleep that map onto these ultradian cycles. So it would be better off to get a three hour, like two 90 minute cycles than to a four hour batch of sleep because waking up in the middle of those ultradian cycles can just be brutal for parent and kid. So if one can't get a full six or 
Getting embedding for:10 or some kids should even be sleeping 12 hours when they're growing quickly, trying to get batches of sleep, even if they're fractured throughout the 24 hour cycle that are matched more to these 90 minute cycles, meaning maybe one ultradian cycle of 90 minutes or two back to back or three back to back to back. That's going to be better than waking up in the middle

Getting embedding for:of an ultradian cycle. It's just going to set any number of other things in a better direction than were you to try to say, just enforce or force a full eight or 10 hours of sleep. That's at least what the literature shows. Some kids sleep great through the night, starting at a very young age, others don't. I typically hear from people who are struggling tremendously.

Getting embedding for:sleep is really, really dismantled and meaning it's happening in various times of day or night, that's especially, at those times it's going to be especially important for the parent to get morning and evening sunlight because your circadian clock is going into a tail spin and it basically wants to anchor to something. So you want to give it two anchors, morning 
Getting embedding for:and evening light. Okay, so this is rather different than what I described for shift work. This is when things are really chaotic and you're just not able to sleep. Similar circumstances can arise if you're taking care of a very sick loved one, you're up all night, try and stay calm using NSDR protocols. I know it's harder to do than to say, but those protocols are 
Getting embedding for:there, they're free. There's research to support them. Try and get sleep whenever you can, but also try to get morning sunlight and evening sunlight in your eyes if you can. And if you can't get that, use artificial light, okay? What about later life? So kids now, adolescents, teens, it is true that teens have a tendency to wake up later and go to sleep later. In part, 
Getting embedding for:just because they're sleeping a lot more, they're churning out gonadotropin releasing hormone and luteinizing hormone, their whole bodies are changing. I don't know whether or not people realize this, but the fastest rate of aging that any of us will ever undergo is puberty. That is the fastest rate of aging. And so there's a huge number of biological processes 
Getting embedding for:that are happening during puberty, probably devote a whole episode to puberty is a fascinating aspect to the life course, but it is an accelerated period of aging. And the circadian clock mechanisms sometimes are very intact and sometimes they're a little dismantled and going through some change, but prioritize the duration of sleep for adolescents and teens. 
Getting embedding for:Now, if that means they're sleeping until 2 p.m. and then waking up and then they're up all night, the up all night part can become a problem, especially with all the devices texting in their rooms or playing video games. Morning and evening sunlight would be ideal, but some kids are just going to sleep through the morning sunlight. However, if you were to measure 
Getting embedding for:their temperature, what you would find is that their temperature minimum would come later in the morning. It's not going to be 8 a.m. It's going to be maybe even 10 a.m. if they're sleeping until 11 or 12, or it might be 8 a.m. if they're sleeping until 10. Remember, temperature minimum is two hours before your average waking time, typically. So in teens, it maximizes 
Getting embedding for:the total amount of sleep. Try and get regular sunlight either in the morning or in the evening or both, but if they're sleeping through the morning sunrise, that's probably not as much of an issue. Waking them up and depriving them of sleep is probably worse because their team in, their temperature minimum is actually falling later. So their circadian dead zone 
Getting embedding for:is later, et cetera. So I think with adolescents and teens, it makes sense to kind of give them a little bit more rope in terms of allowing them some leeway to adjust their own schedule. Some schools are even starting classes later on the basis of some very good biology to support this late shifted rhythm and this extended sleep phase. There are data from Dr. Jamie 
Getting embedding for:Zeitzer, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and others at Stanford showing that turning on the lights in the room of a teen before they wake up helps them get more sleep the subsequent night. It also tricks them into going to sleep a little bit earlier, but it gives them about 45 minutes more of deep sleep. And that's been shown statistically, total 
Getting embedding for:sleep time increases as well. If they're hiding under the covers, that's not going to work, but their eyes don't have to be open. I know a few parents now that are coming in with a flashlight and flashing their kids over their eyelids before they wake up in hopes of getting this to work. Some have told me this is working. That's not part of a standard study, but it does 
Getting embedding for:seem to work because, now you should know why, because if light's getting through the eyelids and it's say 8 a.m. and the kid is still asleep and they're going to wake up at 10, you're giving them light just after or around their temperature minimum, which is going to make them want to go to sleep earlier. And in the case of teens, for some reason, we don't quite understand 
Getting embedding for:sleep longer, about 45 minutes longer, spend more time in deep sleep. Adults can do this too, if you can persuade someone or put your lights on timer for lights to go on before you wake up, that's really going to help you wake up earlier. Okay, so if you're starting to hear some themes are really resounding over and over again, that should be reassuring to you, right? 
Getting embedding for:These are core mechanisms. Fortunately, there aren't a thousand different mechanisms. Now in the elderly, there's a real tendency to want to go to sleep very early and wake up very early. And people should talk to their physician. There is some evidence that melatonin levels and patterns of melatonin secretion can become a little chaotic in elderly folks. What 
Getting embedding for:do I mean by elderly? Well, it's going to differ, rates of aging differ, right? You see some 65 year olds that are struggling to move and are and seem much older than some 65 year olds that are still hustling around and have tons of energy. There's a lot of variation, some of it's genetic, some of it's lifestyle factors, you know, it really varies. Certainly lifestyle 
Getting embedding for:factors can play an important role in rates of aging. I think that the most prominent results from sleep and circadian rhythms in the elderly are they need to get as much natural light, even if it's through windows. I realize that some elderly folks can't get outside as easily. It's not safe for them to do it. They can't move around as easily. Exercise can come in various 
Getting embedding for:forms. For people that can't get outside and get a ton of sunlight by jogging or cycling, they're not able to do that. Light through a window in that case, open window ideally, but for temperature reasons, et cetera, sometimes the window has to be closed. Getting people near that window and away from artificial light early in the day and away from artificial lights 
Getting embedding for:during the night phase can have a tremendous effect. And in the elderly, that's when melatonin might be a viable option. And this should be discussed with a physician, of course, but you're way past the puberty time point. In most cases, people who are in their 70s and 80s and 90s are not churning out a lot of GNRH and luteinizing hormone to begin with. And that's where 
Getting embedding for:struggles with falling asleep and staying asleep, all the same parameters and things we've described before still apply, light, exercise, temperature, et cetera, but that's where melatonin might be of greatest benefit. And again, I'm not pushing melatonin here, but I think for elderly folks who are having trouble falling and staying asleep, that might be

There are, and I should just also mention that regular schedule for folks that are elderly and as much natural light as safely possible, those are going to be the key levers for adjusting sleep and circadian schedules.

We are going to get to some of the harder topics. Someone came at me, it's always fun when somebody does this, and they say, well, these are just the kind of basal low level questions. What about the big stuff? What about dreaming

Getting embedding for:the electrolytes, and that's because neurons can only be electrically active by way of movement of particular ions, which include things like sodium, potassium, and magnesium. So without those, you can't think, you can't function, and it actually can be quite dangerous. So why all the excitement about intermittent fasting? Well, a lot of the excitement relates

Getting embedding for:early in the day would lead to more synthesis of muscle than ingesting protein later in the day?

I think most people are aware of that, that your muscles are not just one big blob of tissue. A lot of these little fibers

These cells make a gene called BMAL. BMAL, B-M-A-L, is a clock gene. And the expression of this clock gene varies across the 24-hour cycle.

Getting embedding for:The circadian regulation of this BMAL gene turns out to be vitally important for this protein synthesis mechanism. How do we know that? Well, in this particular study, because they had a mouse that lacked BMAL, the gene was knocked out, they had a bunch of these mice, they were able to explore whether or not this early-day feeding effect was present or absent in 
Getting embedding for:these mice that lack the gene BMAL. And indeed, it was absent. In other words, the effect of increased protein synthesis early in the day was eliminated in the absence of the BMAL gene. So what this means is that when you wake up in the morning, assuming you're following a standard schedule of being asleep at night and awake during the day, your muscle cells are primed 
Getting embedding for:to incorporate amino acids and synthesize muscle, regardless of whether or not you wait trained the night before at 8 p.m. or you don't wait trained at all, or you wait trained afterwards or before. I said five to 10 p.m. is the sort of critical window for this increased protein synthesis. All this means is that if you are interested in maintaining or enhancing muscle 
Getting embedding for:tissue volume, that you might want to consider eating quality protein and amino acids early in the day. You could train first, you could train after, you could not train at all. That's an entirely different discussion. What is quality protein? Well, quality protein is going to be a protein that includes most of the essential amino acids and in particular leucine. 
Getting embedding for:Now, there's a lot of debate as to whether or not you can get all the essential amino acids from a purely plant-based diet or whether or not you need to ingest animal-based foods or not. The term quality protein has no strict scientific definition. Some people define quality protein as a protein that has a high essential amino acid to caloric ratio. What that means 
Getting embedding for:is a small piece of chicken or steak or eggs, for instance, will have many essential amino acids with a low caloric content relative to, say, beans or plant-based foods that can also get you essential amino acids, but it requires more calories to access those essential amino acids. Now, that's a debate that has many exceptions and nuances. And I, for one, am perfectly 
Getting embedding for:respectful of the folks that just want to ingest plant-based foods in order to get their high quality protein. I think that actually can be done. One has to be careful and thoughtful in their choices about how to do that. So this really isn't about animal-based versus non-animal-based foods. This is about getting quality amino acids early in the day from whatever 
Getting embedding for:foods are in alignment with your particular values and your particular eating plan. So that's a lot of information, but the key takeaways are every cell in your muscles has a clock gene. The clock genes vary such that protein synthesis is greater early in the day than it is later in the day, such that in both mice and in humans, ingestion of quality proteins early 
Getting embedding for:in the day will be more so incorporated into muscle than the proteins that are ingested late in the day. And of course, there are the caveats of, if you're training hard late in the day, if you're adjusting your hormone status through whatever mechanism, et cetera, protein synthesis can also be high later in the day, but for most people, it's going to taper off due 
Getting embedding for:to this circadian B-mal gene related mechanism. Again, we will provide a link to the study. And the other key takeaways were that nobody knows, nobody can tell you what healthy feeding windows are, what the best feeding windows are. There's absolutely no information in that context. You talk to 10 nutritionists or academics or trainers or individuals about 
Getting embedding for:what healthy eating is, and you are going to get vastly different answers. And that's one of the reasons why I believe that the internet in particular social media are so filled with contradictory opinions. But the calories in versus calories burned formula is the more or less holy foundation of all things about nutrition, eating, and weight. And as we transition 
Getting embedding for:today into the discussion about eating disorders, I'd like you to keep this in mind because for the treatment of eating disorders, it doesn't matter what psychological or early trauma-based effects led to the eating disorder if the person isn't adjusting their feeding behavior in a way that is going to ameliorate the symptoms of that disorder, which is ultimately 
Getting embedding for:the goal. I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab podcast is now partnered with Momentus Supplements. We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons. First of all, they ship internationally because we know that many of you are located outside of the United States. Second of all, and perhaps most important, the quality of their supplements 
Getting embedding for:is second to none, both in terms of purity and precision of the amounts of the ingredients. Third, we've really emphasized supplements that are single ingredient supplements and that are supplied in dosages that allow you to build a supplementation protocol that's optimized for cost, that's optimized for effectiveness, and that you can add things and remove 
Getting embedding for:things from your protocol in a way that's really systematic and scientific. If you'd like to see the supplements that we partner with Momentus on, you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman. There you'll see those supplements, and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding the library of supplements available through Momentus on a regular basis. 
Getting embedding for:Again, that's livemomentus.com slash Huberman. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank 
Getting embedding for:the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink. I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012, so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day is that it helps 
Getting embedding for:me cover all of my basic nutritional needs. It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have. In addition, it has probiotics, which are vital for microbiome health. I've done a couple of episodes now on the so-called gut microbiome and the ways in which the microbiome interacts with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood, and essentially with every 
Getting embedding for:biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body. With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need, the minerals I need, and the probiotics to support my microbiome. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman and claim a special offer. They'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin 
Getting embedding for:D3K2. There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3 is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health. Even if we're getting a lot of sunshine, many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3. And K2 is also important because it regulates things like cardiovascular function, calcium in the body, and so on. Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman 
Getting embedding for:to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin D3K2. Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I am a big fan of getting regular blood work 
Getting embedding for:done, and I've been trying to do it as much as I can afford for years. The reason is that many of the factors that impact our immediate and long-term health can only be discovered from a quality blood test. With most blood tests and DNA tests, however, you get information back, but not a lot of information about what to do with those numbers. With InsideTracker, they 
Getting embedding for:give you a lot of specific recommendations as to lifestyle factors, and nutrition factors, supplementation factors, things you may want to add to your life, or things you may want to delete from your life in order to bring the numbers into the ranges that are best for your immediate and long-term health. There's simply no replacement for these kinds of data. And

Today's episode is also brought to us by thesis. Thesis makes what are called 
Getting embedding for:nootropics, which means smart drugs. Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics. I don't believe in smart drugs in the sense that I don't believe that there's any one substance or collection of substances that can make us smarter. I do believe based on science, however, that there are particular neural circuits and brain functions that allow us to be 
Getting embedding for:more focused, more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera. That's just the way that the brain works, different neural circuits for different brain states. Thesis understands this. And as far as I know, they're the first nootropics company to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes. I've been using thesis for more than six months 
Getting embedding for:now, and I can confidently say that the nootropics have been a total game changer. My go-to formula is the clarity formula, or sometimes I'll use their energy formula before training. To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit, go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman, take a three-minute quiz, and Thesis will send you four different formulas to

And as we do that, I want to emphasize again that nobody can really define what healthy eating is with a single protocol. However, there is some general agreement about what unhealthy and disordered 
Getting embedding for:eating is. There are clear criteria in the psychiatric and psychological communities to define things like anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorder, all of which we will talk about. But as we have that discussion, I want to emphasize that self-diagnosis can be both a terrific, but also a very precarious thing. We talked about this a little bit in the episode 
Getting embedding for:about depression. There's always a temptation as one learns about the symptomology of a given disorder. Doesn't really matter what the disorder is. To ask the question, well, do I have that? Does so-and-so that I know have that? Ah, I see this sort of behavior or that pattern of thinking in that individual. It's tempting to diagnose them and or ourselves as either 
Getting embedding for:having or not having a particular disorder. However, diagnoses really need to be carried out by people who are trained in that particular field and that have deep expertise in recognizing the symptomology, including some of the more subtle symptomology of eating disorders. So if any of the symptoms resonate with you by way of you thinking that you have this particular 
Getting embedding for:disorder or someone that you know has a disorder, I would take that seriously, but I would take that information to a qualified healthcare professional that could diagnose or rule out any of these possible disorders. I say that not to protect us, but to protect you because information is valuable. And I do believe that knowledge of knowledge can be very valuable 
Getting embedding for:in navigating any topic and improving our thoughts and behaviors around that topic. But one doesn't want to, or I should say, one shouldn't start to self-diagnose simply on the basis of information without running that through the filter of a qualified professional. So what is an eating disorder? Well, we have to take a step back and confess to the fact that every 
Getting embedding for:society, every culture, every family, and every individual has a different relationship to food. Eating disorders, however, have particular criteria that allow us to define them and to think about different modes of treatment as it relates to the particular symptoms, in particular the psychological and biological symptoms of those disorders. Now that's 
Getting embedding for:a mouthful, no pun intended. What are the major eating disorders? Anorexia nervosa, most commonly referred to as anorexia, is perhaps the most prevalent and the most dangerous of all eating disorders. In fact, anorexia is the most dangerous psychiatric disorder of all, even more than depression. The probability of death for untreated anorexia is very high. 
Getting embedding for:And sadly, the prevalence of anorexia is very high. So what is anorexia and how prevalent is it? Anorexia, if you look it up online or you talk to a qualified professional, is essentially a failure to eat enough to maintain a healthy weight. You can see all sorts of very troubling symptoms of somebody who's been anorexic for some period of time, a general loss of muscle 
Getting embedding for:mass because they're ingesting fewer calories than they burn, muscle is very metabolically active, they tend to lose a lot of muscle mass, they will have a low heart rate. This is the body and brain's attempt to lower energy output. They will have low blood pressure. They will sometimes have symptoms like fainting. They will have sometimes even hair growth on 
Getting embedding for:the face, something called lanugo, which is essentially the body's attempt to insulate the body because of loss of body heat when you're that thin. Loss of bone density, osteoporosis, loss of periods in girls and women, and all sorts of disrupted gut and immune functions. So there are just tons of terrible symptoms of anorexia that really placed the anorexic 
Getting embedding for:into a very risky state, which is why mortality from anorexia gone untreated is extremely high. Now, one of the misconceptions about anorexia is that it stems from an overemphasis on perfectionism, or that because of all the images in social media and in advertising of extremely thin and fit or muscular people, that individuals are looking at themselves and 
Getting embedding for:comparing themselves to those images and thinking that they don't match up and developing anorexia. That turns out to not be the case. If you look at the prevalence or the rates of anorexia in the last 10 years or 20 years, and you compare that to when anorexia was first identified, which was in the 1600s and perhaps even earlier, what you find is that rates of anorexia 
Getting embedding for:are not going up. So this idea that the images that we're being bombarded with are causing anorexia doesn't seem to be true. Now, that is not to say that the images that we, in particular, young people are being bombarded with are healthy for their psychological state of mind. But classically defined anorexia has existed at essentially the same prevalence for 
Getting embedding for:the last 100, 200, 300, and 400 years, which is incredible and really speaks to the likelihood that there's a strong biological contribution to what we call anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa is extremely common. It's anywhere from one to 2% of women. And the typical onset is in adolescence, close to puberty, but it can show up later in life as well. In fact, the 
Getting embedding for:identification and diagnosis of anorexia tends to be in the early 20s. But if you look back at the history of those individuals, there were typically signs of anorexia that stem back into their early teens or maybe even before that. Now, of course, men can be anorexic as well, but anorexia nervosa does seem to occur at 10 times the rate in women and young girls than 
Getting embedding for:it does in men and young boys. So while there does seem to be more of a prevalence of anorexia in boys and young men these days, that's probably due to better diagnosis and detection than it is to some sort of societal shift related to imagery, et cetera. Later, we will talk about body dysmorphia and some of the images that are present in media. And social media and how 
Getting embedding for:those are impacting other forms of eating disorders. But when you look at anorexia nervosa, this failure to maintain weight even to healthy levels and often drops in weight that are very dangerous or even deadly, that has existed for a very long time and seems to be somewhat hardwired into the biology of individuals that suffer from it. Now, when I say hardwired, 
Getting embedding for:that doesn't mean that it can't be treated or cured, and indeed it can. So bulimia, which is defined as binge eating or overeating, let me explain what that is. Binge eating is consuming vast amounts of calories in a short period of time. Over eating can be ingesting more calories than one needs, but over an extended period of time, both can exist of course. But bulimia 
Getting embedding for:is also very common. It's more common in young girls and in women than it is in young boys and in men, but it is present in both sexes. Bulimia and rates of bulimia might be increasing. That's sort of an interesting finding. It's not quite clear whether or not it's existed in its same form for a long period of time or whether or not there are new forms that are evolving 
Getting embedding for:or showing up. We're going to drill into bulimia and what it actually is and what it represents. But one thing I want to be clear about, just as the perfectionist mindset has been associated with anorexia, and it turns out that's not the case. It can be, but it's not always associated with anorexia. There was the idea that bulimia is associated with early trauma in 
Getting embedding for:childhood, in particular sexual trauma. And while that can be the case, there's no direct correlation between the two. Now, obviously psychological phenomena and trauma can have a profound impact on the way that the brain wires up and the way that people approach food and other types of behaviors. But the sort of classic idea was that all anorexics are perfectionists.
