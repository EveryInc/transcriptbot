"TRANSCRIPT INTRODUCTION Today, we're talking all about goals, and the science of goal setting and achieving your goals. There's a tremendous amount of information on the internet and in books and so forth, about how to set goals and assess your progress towards goals and update your goals and so forth. In fact, there are so many programmes out there, that include so many different acronyms, that it can be a little bit overwhelming. Today's conversation about goals is going to be quite a bit different. Indeed, we are going to talk about: setting goals, how to assess progress towards goals. goal execution. However, we're going to do all of this in the context of neuroscience. Because it turns out that there are not hundreds or dozens or even several neural circuits in your brain that control goal setting and movement toward your goals. There is one and while it includes many different brain areas, that one circuit is the same circuit that's responsible for pursuing all goals. And it relates to some very basic neurochemical mechanisms that are understood. So while there's a wealth of information out there about goals and goal setting, and goal, achievement, and so forth, there's comparatively ",Goals,Andrew Huberman,0.024344569288389514
"little information that's been available to the public about the neuroscience of goal setting and goal achievement. And we are going to establish specific protocols that you can use for goal setting, goal assessment and goal execution on an ongoing basis, regardless of what your personal goals happen to be. THE 85% RULE In earlier podcasts we talked about neuroplasticity, which is the brain's ability to change in response to experience. In fact, neuroplasticity underlies all forms of learning whether or not it's language learning, or learning music or math, or physical skill. All forms of learning involve the reorganisation of connections in the nervous system, the brain and spinal cord and body. One of the key principles of neuroplasticity is this notion of making errors, as a good thing toward neuroplasticity is a little bit counterintuitive. But what the scientific literature tells us is that whenever we're trying to learn something new, if we make an error, we know it feels frustrating. But that state of frustration, actually queues up particular brain areas to be more alert so that on subsequent attempts to learn that thing, we have a heightened level of focus and a higher ",Goals,Andrew Huberman,0.04307116104868914
